# Fabric Roll Stock Management System

A cross-platform inventory management system built with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM), designed to manage fabric roll inventory in a small business environment.

## Overview
This app was developed to support stock management for my familyâ€™s textile company. It allows staff to easily record fabric roll entries, track stock, and search rolls.  
Currently, the project is in early stage of development and contains minimum features:
- In/Out Management: Record incoming and outgoing fabric rolls with essential details
- Search: Look up rolls by id, item number or order number

## Tech Stack
- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM) - Shared business logic across Android, iOS and Desktop
- Compose Multiplatform - UI framework for building cross-platform apps
- Room â€“ Local database for offline storage
- Ktor - HTTP client for networking and potential backend communication
- [kotlin-inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) â€“ Dependency injection
â€¢ [circuit](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) - UI architecture framework for Compose, handling navigation and presentation logic
- [Store5](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store) - Data loading and caching layer, simplifying offline and network data access
- [kermit](https://github.com/touchlab/Kermit) - Cross-platform logging library

## ðŸš§In Progress
- Export inventory data as CSV
- Authentication and user management
- Add support for Android and iOS apps (currently only supports Desktop)
- Set up proper distribution for each platform
